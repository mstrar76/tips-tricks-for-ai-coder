## Chapter 1: Getting the AI to Do What You Want – The Power of Thoughtful Prompts

If you’re reading this, I’m guessing you’ve heard the big buzz about using AI tools to build websites and apps. Maybe you’ve even opened up one of these tools—Cursor, ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or something similar—and typed, “Make me a website,” only to feel like… I don’t know… something was still missing. Maybe the AI gave you a mishmash of code, and now you’re staring at your screen, thinking, “What on earth do I do with this?”

Don’t worry—you’re not alone. We all start somewhere, and I’m thrilled you’re here because that’s where this guide comes in.

Let me share with you one of the biggest lessons I learned early on when I was just like you. Ready? Here it is: The way you phrase what you ask the AI to do is everything. The difference between getting something brilliant and getting something useless often comes down to how you asked for it. Sounds simple, but this tip alone can save you a lot of frustration.

So, let’s talk about how to ask your AI “coder assistant” for help in a way that actually gets results—because trust me, the way you talk to the AI makes all the difference.

### Why Asking the Right Way Matters

Here’s the deal: AI tools are smart, but they aren’t mind readers. They’re brilliant at following directions, but they need those directions to be clear and specific. If you’re vague or leave room for guessing, things can go sideways fast.

Think of it this way: Imagine you’re hiring a contractor to build you a house. If you say, “Build me something nice,” you might end up with a treehouse when what you really wanted was a three-bedroom ranch with a pool. But if you hand them blueprints and say, “I want this exact house with these exact features,” they’ll know exactly what to do.

AI works the same way. If your instructions are specific, the output will be better. Instead of saying, “Fix this code,” try something like, “Fix the problem with the submit button not working when a user clicks it.” Instead of “Make my app pretty,” say, “Modernize the app’s UI with sleek, professional fonts and high-quality icons.” See the difference? The AI now knows exactly what you want and has a clear path to follow.

### The Magic of Task-Specific Phrases

One trick I’ve learned is to start with the right task-specific phrase—think of it as the secret sauce that gets the AI into the right mode. Here are examples of phrases you can use for different situations. Feel free to copy, tweak, and use these as much as you want.

1. **When Something’s Broken:**
   - Use this: “Fix the problem with…”
   - Example: “Fix the problem with the login button not doing anything when clicked.”

   This tells the AI to focus on fixing one specific issue. Instead of trying to redo your entire code, it homes in on solving just that problem.

   **Pro Tip:** If you know what broke things (like a certain line of code), include that detail. And if you’re not sure? No worries—just focus on describing the symptoms of the problem as clearly as possible.

2. **When Adding New Features:**
   - Use this: “Add a feature to the existing…”
   - Example: “Add a feature to the existing app that allows users to filter products by price without removing any other features.”

   This phrase is worth its weight in gold because it tells the AI two critical things: (1) what you want to add and (2) what not to touch. Trust me, you don’t want the AI to accidentally break something while it’s adding your shiny new feature. That’s why the “without removing any other features” part is so important—it keeps everything else intact.

3. **When You Need to Fix Browser Errors:**
   - Use this: “Fix these errors found in the browser console…”
   - Example: “Fix these errors found in the browser console: [Paste the error messages here].”

   Okay, this might be the most beginner-friendly pro tip ever. If you’re building a web app and things aren’t working, your browser console is like a detective who’s already figured out the crime scene for you. To find it, right-click on your webpage, click “Inspect,” and go to the “Console” tab. You’ll see error messages there—just copy those and paste them into your AI tool.

   Why does this work so well? Because those error messages often contain the exact information the AI needs to figure out what went wrong. It’s like giving it a roadmap for fixing your app. Seriously, this trick is a lifesaver.

4. **When You Want to Improve How Your App Looks:**
   - Use this: “Improve the overall app (or specific part) UI with professional, modern, visually appealing…”
   - Example: “Improve the overall app UI with professional, modern, visually appealing, high-quality fonts, icons, and a cohesive color palette inspired by minimalist designs.”

   Let’s be real—design is subjective. What looks great to one person might not be someone else’s cup of tea. That’s why it’s especially important to guide your AI with words like “modern,” “professional,” and “high-quality.” These kinds of adjectives help the AI understand the overall vibe you’re going for.

   **Pro Tip:** If you have a specific app or website that you love the look of, mention it! For example: “Make this look more like the design of Spotify.” The AI will try to mimic that style and apply it to your project.

5. **When Removing Features:**
   - Use this: “Remove the [feature] and all related code without breaking the core features of the app.”
   - Example: “Remove the search bar and all related code without breaking the shopping cart or user profile features.”

   Removing features can be tricky because you don’t want to accidentally take out something important. This phrase lets the AI know to cleanly remove the feature but leave everything else working exactly as it should.

6. **When You Accidentally Delete Something:**
   - Use this: “I lost the [file], please restore it so that the project looks and functions exactly as it was.”
   - Example: “I lost the style.css file, please restore it so the website looks and functions exactly as it did before.”

   We’ve all been there—you delete a file by mistake, and panic sets in. If this happens, don’t sweat it. Let the AI know what file you lost and give it some context (e.g., “This file handled all the styling for my homepage”). While the AI might not restore the file perfectly, it’ll often provide enough to get things back on track.

### The Key to Success: Get Specific

If there’s one thing you take away from this chapter, let it be this: specificity is everything. The more detail and clarity you give in your prompts, the better the AI will perform. Here’s what I’ve learned:

- Always describe what you want in plain, simple language. Don’t overcomplicate it!
- Focus on one task at a time. Big, multi-part prompts can overwhelm the AI.
- Don’t be afraid to experiment. If the first answer isn’t quite right, tweak your wording and try again.

This process might feel clunky at first, but I promise, the more you practice, the better you’ll get at it.

### Remember, the way you word it matters!

## Chapter 2: When Things Aren't Going Your Way – Troubleshooting with AI and Regaining Momentum

Let’s be real—working with AI to build apps and websites isn’t always smooth sailing. There will be moments when you feel like you’re on a roll, only to hit a wall where nothing seems to work. You’ve given the AI clear instructions (or so you thought), you’ve rephrased your requests, and yet… your project isn’t moving forward.

Don’t panic.

This chapter is all about troubleshooting those frustrating situations and getting yourself unstuck.

### Step 1: Start Fresh – Why a New Conversation Can Save the Day

Sometimes, the AI just… forgets itself. If you find yourself repeating a command over and over, and nothing is changing, the problem might not be with your instructions—it might be the **chat history.**

AI language models work by keeping track of previous instructions and responses in the current conversation. Over time, this history can become **cluttered with conflicting context**. For example:
- You might have asked for a feature earlier and then changed your mind, but the AI is still trying to balance both instructions.
- The AI could be interpreting your new commands in the context of outdated instructions instead of treating them as independent tasks.

**The Fix:** Start a new conversation with the AI.
- Open a fresh chat, paste the most recent version of your code, and explain what you’re trying to accomplish.
- Starting fresh clears the history and eliminates contradictions that may have crept in during your ongoing conversation.
- Bonus: A new chat can often lead to better, more focused results because the AI isn’t distracted by its past “thoughts.” It’s like pressing a reset button.

---

### Step 2: Watch Out for Contradicting Code

If starting fresh doesn’t solve the problem, there’s a chance the issue is in the code itself. Contradicting code happens **when two pieces of code tell your app to do opposite things.** This can often occur when:
- The AI added a new feature but forgot to clean up or remove old code related to a previous version of that feature.
- You’ve tried to patch multiple problems one at a time, and the AI accidentally created logic overlaps.
- You’re working on a complex project, and somewhere along the way, something got tangled.

For example:
- Imagine you’re creating a button for your app. One part of your code says, *“When the button is clicked, submit the form.”* Another part says, *“When the button is clicked, refresh the page.”* Now the app is confused—does the button submit or refresh?

**The Fix:** Ask the AI to identify and resolve contradictions.
Using the chat feature of your AI assistant, you can give it a prompt like, *“Review my code and identify any parts that might be contradicting each other.”* Then paste the relevant sections into the chat.

**Another Fix:** Debug manually.
If the AI isn’t catching the problem (or you just want more control), start testing pieces of your app one at a time. Disable or comment out parts of the code and see how the app behaves when those sections aren’t running. This process can help you locate the specific lines causing the conflict.

---

### Step 3: Use AI as a Debugging Partner Without Making Immediate Changes

Here’s a game-changer: **AI doesn’t always need to write code for you.** You can also use it as a trusted debugging partner to answer your questions and guide you through problems without actually changing your project. This approach gives you more control and can help you better understand how everything is connected.

For example, you can ask:
- *“What might be causing my app to crash when I click the submit button?”*
- *“How does this section of my JavaScript interact with the CSS styling below?”*
- *“What impact would deleting this variable have on the rest of the code?”*

This back-and-forth isn’t about handing over control to the AI—it’s about using it as a coding coach. By treating AI as a teacher rather than a task executor, you can unlock insights that help you troubleshoot faster and better.

### Step 4: Try a Different AI Model or Platform

If one AI model isn’t giving you answers you can work with, try mixing things up. Different models have different strengths:
- **ChatGPT (especially GPT-4):** Great for general-purpose coding advice, debugging, and generating reusable code snippets.
- **Claude (Anthropic):** Often excels at understanding complex instructions and summarizing code but can miss finer debugging details.
- **Gemini (Google):** May provide additional context if you’re dealing with Google-related tools or technologies.
- **Specialized Coding Assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot):** Integrated directly into IDEs for real-time coding help.

Here’s how to do it:
1. Copy your current code or problem description.
2. Paste it into another model.
3. Ask the same or similar question.

Even if you’ve been working exclusively with one tool, switching to another can provide valuable new perspectives (and solutions).

---

### Step 5: Enable Changelogs in Your IDE or AI Assistant

Changelogs are lifesavers. They let you:
- Track exactly what the AI edited or added to your project.
- Roll back changes if something goes wrong.
- Compare older versions of your code to pinpoint issues.

Many tools and IDEs allow you to enable changelogs or version history. If not, you can use Git for version control to achieve the same effect.

---

### Step 6: Consider Switching Programming Languages

Sometimes, the issue isn’t you or the AI—it’s the language you’ve chosen. If your app isn’t working well or feels overly complex, ask the AI:
*“Is [current language] the best choice for this project?”*

This one shift can be a game-changer.
