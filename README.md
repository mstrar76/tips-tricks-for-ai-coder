## Chapter 1: Getting the AI to Do What You Want – The Power of Thoughtful Prompts

If you’re reading this, I’m guessing you’ve heard the big buzz about using AI tools to build websites and apps. Maybe you’ve even opened up one of these tools—ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or something similar—and typed, “Make me a website,” only to feel like… I don’t know… something was still missing. Maybe the AI gave you a mishmash of code, and now you’re staring at your screen, thinking, “What on earth do I do with this?”

Don’t worry—you’re not alone. We all start somewhere, and I’m thrilled you’re here because that’s where this guide comes in.

Let me share with you one of the biggest lessons I learned early on when I was just like you. Ready? Here it is: The way you phrase what you ask the AI to do is everything. The difference between getting something brilliant and getting something useless often comes down to how you asked for it. Sounds simple, but this tip alone can save you a lot of frustration.

So, let’s talk about how to ask your AI “coder assistant” for help in a way that actually gets results—because trust me, the way you talk to the AI makes all the difference.

### Why Asking the Right Way Matters

Here’s the deal: AI tools are smart, but they aren’t mind readers. They’re brilliant at following directions, but they need those directions to be clear and specific. If you’re vague or leave room for guessing, things can go sideways fast.

Think of it this way: Imagine you’re hiring a contractor to build you a house. If you say, “Build me something nice,” you might end up with a treehouse when what you really wanted was a three-bedroom ranch with a pool. But if you hand them blueprints and say, “I want this exact house with these exact features,” they’ll know exactly what to do.

AI works the same way. If your instructions are specific, the output will be better. Instead of saying, “Fix this code,” try something like, “Fix the problem with the submit button not working when a user clicks it.” Instead of “Make my app pretty,” say, “Modernize the app’s UI with sleek, professional fonts and high-quality icons.” See the difference? The AI now knows exactly what you want and has a clear path to follow.

### The Magic of Task-Specific Phrases

One trick I’ve learned is to start with the right task-specific phrase—think of it as the secret sauce that gets the AI into the right mode. Here are examples of phrases you can use for different situations. Feel free to copy, tweak, and use these as much as you want.

1. **When Something’s Broken:**
   - Use this: “Fix the problem with…”
   - Example: “Fix the problem with the login button not doing anything when clicked.”

   This tells the AI to focus on fixing one specific issue. Instead of trying to redo your entire code, it homes in on solving just that problem.

   **Pro Tip:** If you know what broke things (like a certain line of code), include that detail. And if you’re not sure? No worries—just focus on describing the symptoms of the problem as clearly as possible.

2. **When Adding New Features:**
   - Use this: “Add a feature to the existing…”
   - Example: “Add a feature to the existing app that allows users to filter products by price without removing any other features.”

   This phrase is worth its weight in gold because it tells the AI two critical things: (1) what you want to add and (2) what not to touch. Trust me, you don’t want the AI to accidentally break something while it’s adding your shiny new feature. That’s why the “without removing any other features” part is so important—it keeps everything else intact.

3. **When You Need to Fix Browser Errors:**
   - Use this: “Fix these errors found in the browser console…”
   - Example: “Fix these errors found in the browser console: [Paste the error messages here].”

   Okay, this might be the most beginner-friendly pro tip ever. If you’re building a web app and things aren’t working, your browser console is like a detective who’s already figured out the crime scene for you. To find it, right-click on your webpage, click “Inspect,” and go to the “Console” tab. You’ll see error messages there—just copy those and paste them into your AI tool.

   Why does this work so well? Because those error messages often contain the exact information the AI needs to figure out what went wrong. It’s like giving it a roadmap for fixing your app. Seriously, this trick is a lifesaver.

4. **When You Want to Improve How Your App Looks:**
   - Use this: “Improve the overall app (or specific part) UI with professional, modern, visually appealing…”
   - Example: “Improve the overall app UI with professional, modern, visually appealing, high-quality fonts, icons, and a cohesive color palette inspired by minimalist designs.”

   Let’s be real—design is subjective. What looks great to one person might not be someone else’s cup of tea. That’s why it’s especially important to guide your AI with words like “modern,” “professional,” and “high-quality.” These kinds of adjectives help the AI understand the overall vibe you’re going for.

   **Pro Tip:** If you have a specific app or website that you love the look of, mention it! For example: “Make this look more like the design of Spotify.” The AI will try to mimic that style and apply it to your project.

5. **When Removing Features:**
   - Use this: “Remove the [feature] and all related code without breaking the core features of the app.”
   - Example: “Remove the search bar and all related code without breaking the shopping cart or user profile features.”

   Removing features can be tricky because you don’t want to accidentally take out something important. This phrase lets the AI know to cleanly remove the feature but leave everything else working exactly as it should.

6. **When You Accidentally Delete Something:**
   - Use this: “I lost the [file], please restore it so that the project looks and functions exactly as it was.”
   - Example: “I lost the style.css file, please restore it so the website looks and functions exactly as it did before.”

   We’ve all been there—you delete a file by mistake, and panic sets in. If this happens, don’t sweat it. Let the AI know what file you lost and give it some context (e.g., “This file handled all the styling for my homepage”). While the AI might not restore the file perfectly, it’ll often provide enough to get things back on track.

### The Key to Success: Get Specific

If there’s one thing you take away from this chapter, let it be this: specificity is everything. The more detail and clarity you give in your prompts, the better the AI will perform. Here’s what I’ve learned:

- Always describe what you want in plain, simple language. Don’t overcomplicate it!
- Focus on one task at a time. Big, multi-part prompts can overwhelm the AI.
- Don’t be afraid to experiment. If the first answer isn’t quite right, tweak your wording and try again.

This process might feel clunky at first, but I promise, the more you practice, the better you’ll get at it.

### Remember, the way you word it matters!
